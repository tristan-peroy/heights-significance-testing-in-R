# Introduction 

This project aims to decide if the difference between the average heights of people in countries X and Y is significant.


# Question 1

Read in the data.

```{r}
df1 <- read.table("x_data.txt", sep=",", header=T)
x=df1$x
df2 <- read.table("y_data.txt", sep=",", header=T)
y=df2$y
```

# Question 2

The datasets have different sizes, so sample 100 elements of each and make a scatter plot. We also make a boxplot.

<!--
This block is a comment, below is a code chunk.
Setting the out.width option specifies how large to make any plots.
You can increase/decrease the size of the plot by changing the value 0.7
-->


```{r, out.width="0.7\\linewidth"}
boxplot(x,y,names=c('x','y'),xlab='Heights',main='Box plot to compare sample distribution of X and Y')
x_sample=sample(x,100)
y_sample=sample(y,100)
plot(x_sample,y_sample,xlab="sample of heights in country X",
ylab="sample of heights in country Y",main='Scatter graph comparing heights in X and Y')
```

# Question 3

The observations are $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{n}$ and the random variables are
$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$. Likewise for $y_1,y_2, \dots, y_{n}$.

The null hypothesis is:  

  - $H_0$ The average height of people in country X is equal to the average height of people in country Y.
 
The alternative hypothesis is:  

  - $H_1$ The average height of people in country X is different to the average height of people in country Y.
  
I plan to use Student's two-sample test, as we are comparing two population means.
We need to assume the $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ follow a normal distribution with
$\theta_1$ mean and $\sigma_1^2$ distribution, while the $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n$
follow a normal distribution with $\theta_2$ mean and $\sigma_2^2$ distribution.
I will assume also that $\sigma_1^2$ = $\sigma_2^2$ = $\sigma^2$ in order to
obtain a pooled sample variance. In summary, the means are unknown, the variances
are unknown but assumed equal and we assume the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are
independent.
 
The significance threshold is $\alpha=0.01$.

# Question 4

I assumed normal distributions for the data. Test this using a qqplot on the samples. First standardize the data.We can see the data is normally distributed as assumed. We cannot test the mean or the variance as we only have a sample. In both cases the qqplot matches the y=x line quite closely so they both follow a normal distribution.
```{r}
new_x=(x-mean(x))/sqrt(var(x))
qqnorm(new_x)
abline(0, 1, col="red")
new_y=(y-mean(y))/sqrt(var(y))
qqnorm(new_y)
abline(0, 1, col="red")
mean(x);sd(x)
mean(y);sd(y)
```

# Question 5

We compute test statistic t and critical threshold to compare to the modulus of t. The threshold is from a t-distribution with n+m-2 levels of freedom where n and m are the lengths of x and y, and 1-alpha/2.
```{r}
sample_var_x=((1/(length(x)-1))*sum((x-mean(x))**2))
sample_var_y=((1/(length(y)-1))*sum((y-mean(y))**2))
sample_var_x
sample_var_y
pooled_sample_var=((length(x)-1)*sample_var_x+(length(y)-1)*sample_var_y)/(length(x)+length(y)-2)
pooled_sample_var
t=(mean(x)-mean(y))/(sqrt(pooled_sample_var)*(sqrt(1/length(x)+1/length(y))))
t
critical_threshold=qt(1-0.01/2,length(x)+length(y)-2)
critical_threshold

```
# Question 6

In conclusion, the absolute value of the statistic t is greater than the critical value, therefore the null hypothesis is rejected, and the data supports the case that
the average height of people in countries X and Y is different.
